CoVa
--------------

Variant analysis pipeline for Coronavirus genomes. Specifically, COVID19.
This pipeline performs following analyses on a collection of coronavirus genomes.
 
* Whole-genome Multiple Sequence Alignment
* Variant calling
* Diversity computation
* Phylogenetic inference
* Positive selection analysis

The following external programs must be present to run CoVa

* **MAFFT** 		: Build Multiple Sequence Alignment
* **Hyphy** 		: Selection analysis to identify sites under positive selection
* **FastTreeMP** 	: Build phylogeny
